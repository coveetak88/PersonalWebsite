            <div class="lifestorydesc">
              <p class="line1"> I was born in the year 2004 and raised in Jakarta, Indonesia. I have 2 siblings and I am the youngest.</p>
              <p> As a child, I was curious and loved to explore the world around me. 
                I spent hours reading books and learning about science and nature. 
                I enjoy watching National Geographical TV Channel as it can widen our knowledge. 
              </p>
              <p class="line2"> Time flew by and now I'm ready to enter my cooperate life. Over the years, I work my way up through the ranks and 
                eventually became a top student in my school since I was a junior high student. 
                I also joined organizations, took internships, and participated in volunteer work. 
                Along the way, I learned a lot about leadership and time management and I enjoyed developing my better version and contributing to society.
              </p>
              <p class="line3">Outside of my school time, I usually surf the internet and read news about the recent world's technological development. 
                To add on, I also enhance my language skill by watching movies and thriller dramas during my free time. Not only the language skill that I can improve by watching foreign movies, the storyline can also help me to be more open-minded about 
                what upcoming problems may happen and how to solve them as well.
              </p>
              <p class="line4">I am currently on my sophomore year. I plan to continue working in the tech industry and pursue my dream to be a front-end engineer. 
                Looking back, I am grateful for the opportunities and experiences that life has brought me, and I look forward to what the future holds.</p>
